The AirBnB console focuses on developing a simplified shell, which operates in both interactive and non-interactive modes. This project serves as a fundamental emulation of the core functionalities found within AirBnB's software.

# Command Interpreter: A Simplified Console
The initial component revolves around manipulating a robust storage system. This storage engine provides an abstraction layer between "My objects" and "How they are stored and persisted." In practical terms, this implies that you won't need to concern yourself with the intricacies of object storage when working on the console code (the command interpreter itself) or constructing the future front-end and RestAPI.

## How to Begin:
To initiate the console, you can use the command: `./console.py`.

## How to Use:
- Effortlessly manage (create, update, destroy, etc.) objects through a user-friendly console/command interpreter.
- Seamlessly store and persist objects to a JSON file.
- Available Commands: create, show, destroy, all (displays all), update, help, quit.

### Example of Usage:
```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
